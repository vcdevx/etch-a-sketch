Etch a sketch project

Etch-a-Sketch with the option to change canvas size as well as a built-in surprise!

This project was built for the Odin Project curriculum. It was built using HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript.

What I learned: 
[1] Utilizing event listeners.
[2] More CSS grid techniques.
[3] Rendering more JavaScript elements as well as how to better make them function alongside one another.
